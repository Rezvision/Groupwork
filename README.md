Description:
This GitHub repository contains the source code and assets for the "ClimateAware VR Experience" project, which aims to raise awareness about the environmental impacts of global warming in three distinct areas: Antarctic, Forest, and Urban scenes. The project utilizes virtual reality (VR) technology to immerse users in realistic simulations of these environments, showcasing the effects of climate change.

Features:

Antarctic Scene:

Experience the Antarctic environment with realistic visuals and environmental conditions.
Observe the impact of global warming on ice sheets, wildlife, and the overall ecosystem.

Forest Scene:

Immerse yourself in a virtual forest setting, highlighting the consequences of climate change on vegetation, biodiversity, and forest ecosystems.
Witness the effects of prolonged droughts, increased temperatures, and changing precipitation patterns.

Urban Scene:

Explore an urban environment to understand the implications of global warming on cities and human habitats.
Visualize rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the challenges faced by urban populations.
Teleportation Feature:

Navigate between scenes seamlessly using the teleportation feature.
Press a designated button in the hub to transport the user to the Antarctic, Forest, or Urban scene instantly.
